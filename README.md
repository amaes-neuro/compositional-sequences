# compositional-sequences

The folders contain code used in the paper 'Learning compositional sequences with multiple time scales through a hierarchical network of spiking neurons', Amadeus Maes, Mauricio Barahona, Claudia Clopath.

Uses Matlab.

code_hierarchy: contains all the code to build, train and run the hierarchical model.

code_serial: contains all the code to build, train and run the serial model.

code_appendix: contains all the code to build, train and run the hierarchical model of the appendix.

In each folder a readme.txt explains the code in more detail. Please contact a.maes17@imperial.ac.uk for queries or requests.

Each folder contains a script:

setup_network_simulation.m 

which can be ran to either simulate spontaneous dynamics or for training.
